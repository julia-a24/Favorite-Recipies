		<p>One of my favorite recipies is these Chocolate Chip Cookies from Ghirardelli. I have been making these for as long as I can remember, and I love them so much. This cookie has a light buttery texture on the inside, but a light crispy layer on the outside. This paired with the chocolate chips is one of the best things you will ever taste.</p>

	<p>These Chocolate Crinkle Cokkies are some of the richest cookies that you will ever have. The base of the cookie is a medium dark chocolate and is not the absolute sweetest. However, right before the cookies are put in the oven they are rolled around in a layer of powdered sugar. The small ammount of sweetness on the actual cookie paired with the powdered sugar is one of the best combinations.</p>
