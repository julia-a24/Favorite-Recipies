    <p>If you are looking for a rich, deep chocolate cupcake, this recipe is perfect for you. This cupcake is perfectly moist, soft, and paired with frosting is increadible. Some may find the use of espresso poweder weird, however it helps to bring out the rich flavor of the dark chocolate and all of the other ingredients.

    <p> A fall seasonal favorite of mine is this delicious and easy pumpkin cake recipe. This cake is very moist and flavorful, while also not being to overpowering. Thankfully, this recipe also has steps to make a easy cream cheese frosting that goes perfectling with the pumpkin cake.
