    <p>I have been making this exact scone recipe with my mom for the past four or so years. Even though you do have to subscribe to their website or buy the baking book, it is completely worth it for this recipe. The process of actually making the scones is very easy, and you can mix in many add-ons such as chocolate chips, fruit, or nuts.</p>

     <p>These soft and chewy cinnamon rolls make the perfect morning treats. The warm sugar glaze adds flavor along with the with the generous ammount of cinnamon inside the roll.</p>
